/**
 * Add one or more ranks to an existing Kinetica cluster. The new ranks will
 * not contain any data initially (other than replicated tables) and will not
 * be assigned any shards. To rebalance data and shards across the cluster, use
 * {@link
 * #adminRebalance(const std::map<std::string, std::string>&,AdminRebalanceResponse&) const}.
 * <p>
 * The database must be offline for this operation, see {@link
 * #adminOffline(const bool,const std::map<std::string, std::string>&,AdminOfflineResponse&) const}
 * <p>
 * For example, if attempting to add three new ranks (two ranks on host
 * 172.123.45.67 and one rank on host 172.123.45.68) to a Kinetica cluster with
 * additional configuration parameters:
 * <p>
 * * @a hosts
 *   would be an array including 172.123.45.67 in the first two indices
 *   (signifying two ranks being added to host 172.123.45.67) and
 *   172.123.45.68 in the last index (signifying one rank being added
 *   to host 172.123.45.67)
 * * @a configParams
 *   would be an array of maps, with each map corresponding to the ranks
 *   being added in @a hosts. The key of each map would be
 *   the configuration parameter name and the value would be the
 *   parameter's value, e.g. '{"rank.gpu":"1"}'
 * <p>
 * This endpoint's processing includes copying all replicated table data to the
 * new rank(s) and therefore could take a long time. The API call may time out
 * if run directly.  It is recommended to run this endpoint asynchronously via
 * {@link
 * #createJob(const std::string&,const std::string&,const std::vector<uint8_t>&,const std::string&,const std::map<std::string, std::string>&,CreateJobResponse&) const}.
 * <p>
 * @attention This method should be used for on-premise deployments only.
 * <p>
 * 
 * @param hosts  Array of host IP addresses (matching a hostN.address from the
 *               gpudb.conf file), or host identifiers (e.g. 'host0' from the
 *               gpudb.conf file), on which to add ranks to the cluster. The
 *               hosts must already be in the cluster. If needed beforehand, to
 *               add a new host to the cluster use /admin/add/host. Include the
 *               same entry as many times as there are ranks to add to the
 *               cluster, e.g., if two ranks on host 172.123.45.67 should be
 *               added, @a hosts could look like '["172.123.45.67",
 *               "172.123.45.67"]'. All ranks will be added simultaneously,
 *               i.e. they're not added in the order of this array. Each entry
 *               in this array corresponds to the entry at the same index in
 *               the @a configParams.
 * @param configParams  Array of maps containing configuration parameters to
 *                      apply to the new ranks
 *                      found in @a hosts. For example,
 *                      '{"rank.gpu":"2",
 *                      "tier.ram.rank.limit":"10000000000"}'. Currently, the
 *                      available parameters
 *                      are rank-specific parameters in the <a
 *                      href="../../../config/#config-main-network"

 *                      gpudb.conf file, with the
 *                      key exception of the 'rankN.host' settings in the
 *                      Network section that will be determined by
 *                      @a hosts instead. Though many of these configuration
 *                      parameters typically are affixed with
 *                      'rankN' in the gpudb.conf file (where N is the rank
 *                      number), the 'N' should be omitted in
 *                      @a configParams as the new rank number(s) are not
 *                      allocated until the ranks have been added
 *                      to the cluster. Each entry in this array corresponds to
 *                      the entry at the same index in the
 *                      @a hosts. This array must either be completely empty or
 *                      have the same number of elements as
 *                      the @a hosts.  An empty @a configParams array will
 *                      result in the new ranks being set
 *                      with default parameters.

 * Manage a table's columns--a column can be added, removed, or have its
 * <a href="../../../concepts/types/" target="_top">type and properties</a>
 * modified, including whether it is
 * <a href="../../../concepts/dictionary_encoding/" target="_top">dictionary
 * encoded</a> or not.
 * <p>
 * External tables cannot be modified except for their refresh method.
 * <p>
 * Create or delete an <a href="../../../concepts/indexes/#column-index"
 * target="_top">index</a> on a
 * particular column. This can speed up certain operations when using
 * expressions
 * containing equality or relational operators on indexed columns. This only
 * applies to tables.
 * <p>
 * Create or delete a <a href="../../../concepts/tables/#foreign-key"
 * target="_top">foreign key</a>
 * on a particular column.
 * <p>
 * Manage a

 * table's partitions.
 * <p>
 * Set (or reset) the <a href="../../../rm/concepts/#tier-strategies"

 * <p>
 * Set the <a href="../../../concepts/ttl/" target="_top">time-to-live
 * (TTL)</a>. This can be applied
 * to tables or views.
 * <p>
 * Set the global access mode (i.e. locking) for a table. This setting trumps
 * any
 * role-based access controls that may be in place; e.g., a user with write
 * access
 * to a table marked read-only will not be able to insert records into it. The

 *                 line_number (long), line_rejected (string), error_message
 *                 (string).

 *                 gpudb::create_table_external_bad_record_table_limit: A
 *                 positive integer indicating the maximum number of records
 *                 that can be  written to the bad-record-table.   Default
 *                 value is 10000
 *                         <li>
 *                 gpudb::create_table_external_bad_record_table_limit_per_input:
 *                 For subscriptions: A positive integer indicating the maximum
 *                 number of records that can be written to the
 *                 bad-record-table per file/payload. Default value will be
 *                 'bad_record_table_limit' and total size of the table per
 *                 rank is limited to 'bad_record_table_limit'
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_batch_size:
 *                 Internal tuning parameter--number of records per batch when
 *                 inserting data.
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_column_formats:
 *                 For each target column specified, applies the
 *                 column-property-bound format to the source data
 *                 loaded into that column.  Each column format will contain a
 *                 mapping of one or more of its column
 *                 properties to an appropriate format for each property.
 *                 Currently supported column properties
 *                 include date, time, & datetime. The parameter value must be
 *                 formatted as a JSON string of maps of
 *                 column names to maps of column properties to their
 *                 corresponding column formats, e.g.,
 *                 '{ "order_date" : { "date" : "%Y.%m.%d" }, "order_time" : {
 *                 "time" : "%H:%M:%S" } }'.
 *                 See @a default_column_formats for valid format syntax.
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_columns_to_load:
 *                 Specifies a comma-delimited list of columns from the source
 *                 data to
 *                 load.  If more than one file is being loaded, this list
 *                 applies to all files.
 *                 Column numbers can be specified discretely or as a range.
 *                 For example, a value of '5,7,1..3' will
 *                 insert values from the fifth column in the source data into
 *                 the first column in the target table,
 *                 from the seventh column in the source data into the second
 *                 column in the target table, and from the
 *                 first through third columns in the source data into the
 *                 third through fifth columns in the target
 *                 table.
 *                 If the source data contains a header, column names matching
 *                 the file header names may be provided
 *                 instead of column numbers.  If the target table doesn't
 *                 exist, the table will be created with the
 *                 columns in this order.  If the target table does exist with
 *                 columns in a different order than the
 *                 source data, this list can be used to match the order of the
 *                 target table.  For example, a value of
 *                 'C, B, A' will create a three column table with column C,
 *                 followed by column B, followed by column
 *                 A; or will insert those fields in that order into a table
 *                 created with columns in that order.  If
 *                 the target table exists, the column names must match the
 *                 source data field names for a name-mapping
 *                 to be successful.
 *                 Mutually exclusive with @a columns_to_skip.
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_columns_to_skip:
 *                 Specifies a comma-delimited list of columns from the source
 *                 data to
 *                 skip.  Mutually exclusive with @a columns_to_load.

 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_datasource_name:
 *                 Name of an existing external data source from which data
 *                 file(s) specified in @a filepaths will be loaded
 *                         <li>
 *                 gpudb::create_table_external_default_column_formats:
 *                 Specifies the default format to be applied to source data
 *                 loaded
 *                 into columns with the corresponding column property.
 *                 Currently supported column properties include
 *                 date, time, & datetime.  This default column-property-bound
 *                 format can be overridden by specifying a
 *                 column property & format for a given target column in @a
 *                 column_formats. For
 *                 each specified annotation, the format will apply to all
 *                 columns with that annotation unless a custom
 *                 @a column_formats for that annotation is specified.
 *                 The parameter value must be formatted as a JSON string that
 *                 is a map of column properties to their
 *                 respective column formats, e.g., '{ "date" : "%Y.%m.%d",
 *                 "time" : "%H:%M:%S" }'.  Column
 *                 formats are specified as a string of control characters and
 *                 plain text. The supported control
 *                 characters are 'Y', 'm', 'd', 'H', 'M', 'S', and 's', which
 *                 follow the Linux 'strptime()'
 *                 specification, as well as 's', which specifies seconds and
 *                 fractional seconds (though the fractional
 *                 component will be truncated past milliseconds).
 *                 Formats for the 'date' annotation must include the 'Y', 'm',
 *                 and 'd' control characters. Formats for
 *                 the 'time' annotation must include the 'H', 'M', and either
 *                 'S' or 's' (but not both) control
 *                 characters. Formats for the 'datetime' annotation meet both
 *                 the 'date' and 'time' control character
 *                 requirements. For example, '{"datetime" : "%m/%d/%Y
 *                 %H:%M:%S" }' would be used to interpret text
 *                 as "05/04/2000 12:12:11"
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_error_handling:

 *                 NOTE:

 *                 duplicated on a source local to each host
 *                 to improve performance, though the files must appear as the
 *                 same data set from the perspective of
 *                 all hosts performing the load.
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_distributed_local:
 *                 A single worker process on each node loads all files
 *                 that are available to it. This option works best when each
 *                 worker loads files from its own file
 *                 system, to maximize performance. In order to avoid data
 *                 duplication, either each worker performing
 *                 the load needs to have visibility to a set of files unique
 *                 to it (no file is visible to more than
 *                 one node) or the target table needs to have a primary key
 *                 (which will allow the worker to

 *                 The escape character can also be used to escape the quoting
 *                 character, and will be treated as an

 *                 to take effect.  Delimiters within quoted fields are treated
 *                 as literals and not delimiters.  Within

 *                 number of records that can be written to the
 *                 bad-record-table per file/payload. Default value will be
 *                 'bad_record_table_limit' and total size of the table per
 *                 rank is limited to 'bad_record_table_limit'
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_batch_size:
 *                 Internal tuning parameter--number of records per batch when
 *                 inserting data.
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_column_formats:
 *                 For each target column specified, applies the
 *                 column-property-bound format to the source data
 *                 loaded into that column.  Each column format will contain a
 *                 mapping of one or more of its column
 *                 properties to an appropriate format for each property.
 *                 Currently supported column properties
 *                 include date, time, & datetime. The parameter value must be
 *                 formatted as a JSON string of maps of
 *                 column names to maps of column properties to their
 *                 corresponding column formats, e.g.,
 *                 '{ "order_date" : { "date" : "%Y.%m.%d" }, "order_time" : {
 *                 "time" : "%H:%M:%S" } }'.
 *                 See @a default_column_formats for valid format syntax.
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_columns_to_load:
 *                 Specifies a comma-delimited list of columns from the source
 *                 data to
 *                 load.  If more than one file is being loaded, this list
 *                 applies to all files.
 *                 Column numbers can be specified discretely or as a range.
 *                 For example, a value of '5,7,1..3' will
 *                 insert values from the fifth column in the source data into
 *                 the first column in the target table,
 *                 from the seventh column in the source data into the second
 *                 column in the target table, and from the
 *                 first through third columns in the source data into the
 *                 third through fifth columns in the target
 *                 table.
 *                 If the source data contains a header, column names matching
 *                 the file header names may be provided
 *                 instead of column numbers.  If the target table doesn't
 *                 exist, the table will be created with the
 *                 columns in this order.  If the target table does exist with
 *                 columns in a different order than the
 *                 source data, this list can be used to match the order of the
 *                 target table.  For example, a value of
 *                 'C, B, A' will create a three column table with column C,
 *                 followed by column B, followed by column
 *                 A; or will insert those fields in that order into a table
 *                 created with columns in that order.  If
 *                 the target table exists, the column names must match the
 *                 source data field names for a name-mapping
 *                 to be successful.
 *                 Mutually exclusive with @a columns_to_skip.
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_columns_to_skip:
 *                 Specifies a comma-delimited list of columns from the source
 *                 data to
 *                 skip.  Mutually exclusive with @a columns_to_load.
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_compression_type:

 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_datasource_name:
 *                 Name of an existing external data source from which data
 *                 file(s) specified in @a filepaths will be loaded
 *                         <li>
 *                 gpudb::create_table_external_default_column_formats:
 *                 Specifies the default format to be applied to source data
 *                 loaded
 *                 into columns with the corresponding column property.
 *                 Currently supported column properties include
 *                 date, time, & datetime.  This default column-property-bound
 *                 format can be overridden by specifying a
 *                 column property & format for a given target column in @a
 *                 column_formats. For
 *                 each specified annotation, the format will apply to all
 *                 columns with that annotation unless a custom
 *                 @a column_formats for that annotation is specified.
 *                 The parameter value must be formatted as a JSON string that
 *                 is a map of column properties to their
 *                 respective column formats, e.g., '{ "date" : "%Y.%m.%d",
 *                 "time" : "%H:%M:%S" }'.  Column
 *                 formats are specified as a string of control characters and
 *                 plain text. The supported control
 *                 characters are 'Y', 'm', 'd', 'H', 'M', 'S', and 's', which
 *                 follow the Linux 'strptime()'
 *                 specification, as well as 's', which specifies seconds and
 *                 fractional seconds (though the fractional
 *                 component will be truncated past milliseconds).
 *                 Formats for the 'date' annotation must include the 'Y', 'm',
 *                 and 'd' control characters. Formats for
 *                 the 'time' annotation must include the 'H', 'M', and either
 *                 'S' or 's' (but not both) control
 *                 characters. Formats for the 'datetime' annotation meet both
 *                 the 'date' and 'time' control character
 *                 requirements. For example, '{"datetime" : "%m/%d/%Y
 *                 %H:%M:%S" }' would be used to interpret text
 *                 as "05/04/2000 12:12:11"
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_error_handling:

 *                         <li>
 *                 gpudb::create_table_external_distributed_shared: The head

 *                 all workers.
 *                 NOTE:

 *                 duplicated on a source local to each host
 *                 to improve performance, though the files must appear as the
 *                 same data set from the perspective of
 *                 all hosts performing the load.
 *                         <li> gpudb::create_table_external_distributed_local:
 *                 A single worker process on each node loads all files
 *                 that are available to it. This option works best when each
 *                 worker loads files from its own file
 *                 system, to maximize performance. In order to avoid data
 *                 duplication, either each worker performing
 *                 the load needs to have visibility to a set of files unique
 *                 to it (no file is visible to more than
 *                 one node) or the target table needs to have a primary key
 *                 (which will allow the worker to
 *                 automatically deduplicate data).
 *                 NOTE:
 *                 If the target table doesn't exist, the table structure will
 *                 be determined by the head node. If the
 *                 head node has no files local to it, it will be unable to
 *                 determine the structure and the request
 *                 will fail.
 *                 If the head node is configured to have no worker processes,
 *                 no data strictly accessible to the head
 *                 node will be loaded.
 *                 </ul>

 *                 to take effect.  Delimiters within quoted fields are treated
 *                 as literals and not delimiters.  Within
 *                 a quoted field, two consecutive quote characters will be
 *                 interpreted as a single literal quote

 *                    available for GPU queries.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_text_search: Valid only
 *                    for select 'string' columns. Enables full text
 *                    search--see <a href="../../../concepts/full_text_search/"
 *                    target="_top">Full Text Search</a> for details and
 *                    applicable string column types. Can be set independently
 *                    of @a data and @a store_only.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_store_only: Persist the
 *                    column value but do not make it available to queries
 *                    (e.g. /filter)-i.e. it is mutually exclusive to the @a
 *                    data property. Any 'bytes' type column must have a @a
 *                    store_only property. This property reduces system memory
 *                    usage.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_disk_optimized: Works in
 *                    conjunction with the @a data property for string columns.
 *                    This property reduces system disk usage by disabling
 *                    reverse string lookups. Queries like /filter,
 *                    /filter/bylist, and /filter/byvalue work as usual but
 *                    /aggregate/unique and /aggregate/groupby are not allowed
 *                    on columns with this property.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_timestamp: Valid only for
 *                    'long' columns. Indicates that this field represents a
 *                    timestamp and will be provided in milliseconds since the
 *                    Unix epoch: 00:00:00 Jan 1 1970.  Dates represented by a
 *                    timestamp must fall between the year 1000 and the year
 *                    2900.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_ulong: Valid only for
 *                    'string' columns.  It represents an unsigned long integer
 *                    data type. The string can only be interpreted as an
 *                    unsigned long data type with minimum value of zero, and
 *                    maximum value of 18446744073709551615.

 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_shard_key: This property
 *                    indicates that this column will be part of (or the
 *                    entire) <a href="../../../concepts/tables/#shard-keys"
 *                    target="_top">shard key</a>.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_nullable: This property
 *                    indicates that this column is nullable.  However, setting
 *                    this property is insufficient for making the column
 *                    nullable.  The user must declare the type of the column
 *                    as a union between its regular type and 'null' in the
 *                    avro schema for the record type in @a typeDefinition.
 *                    For example, if a column is of type integer and is
 *                    nullable, then the entry for the column in the avro
 *                    schema must be: ['int', 'null'].
 *                    The C++, C#, Java, and Python APIs have built-in
 *                    convenience for bypassing setting the avro schema by
 *                    hand.  For those languages, one can use this property as
 *                    usual and not have to worry about the avro schema for the
 *                    record.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_dict: This property
 *                    indicates that this column should be <a
 *                    href="../../../concepts/dictionary_encoding/"
 *                    target="_top">dictionary encoded</a>. It can only be used
 *                    in conjunction with restricted string (charN), int, long
 *                    or date columns. Dictionary encoding is best for columns
 *                    where the cardinality (the number of unique values) is
 *                    expected to be low. This property can save a large amount
 *                    of memory.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_init_with_now: For
 *                    'date', 'time', 'datetime', or 'timestamp' column types,
 *                    replace empty strings and invalid timestamps with 'NOW()'
 *                    upon insert.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_init_with_uuid: For
 *                    'uuid' type, replace empty strings and invalid UUID
 *                    values with randomly-generated UUIDs upon insert.

 * @param options  Optional parameters.

/**
 * Creates a new type describing the layout of a table. The type definition is
 * a JSON string describing the fields (i.e. columns) of the type. Each field
 * consists of a name and a data type. Supported data types are: double, float,
 * int, long, string, and bytes. In addition, one or more properties can be
 * specified for each column which customize the memory usage and query
 * availability of that column.  Note that some properties are mutually
 * exclusive--i.e. they cannot be specified for any given column
 * simultaneously.  One example of mutually exclusive properties are @a data
 * and @a store_only.
 * <p>
 * A single <a href="../../../concepts/tables/#primary-keys"
 * target="_top">primary key</a> and/or single <a
 * href="../../../concepts/tables/#shard-keys" target="_top">shard key</a> can
 * be set across one or more columns. If a primary key is specified, then a
 * uniqueness constraint is enforced, in that only a single object can exist
 * with a given primary key column value (or set of values for the key columns,
 * if using a composite primary key). When {@link
 * #insertRecordsRaw(const RawInsertRecordsRequest&) const inserting} data
 * into a table with a primary key, depending on the parameters in the request,
 * incoming objects with primary key values that match existing objects will
 * either overwrite (i.e. update) the existing object or will be skipped and
 * not added into the set.
 * <p>
 * Example of a type definition with some of the parameters::

 *         {"type":"record",
 *         "name":"point",
 *         "fields":[{"name":"msg_id","type":"string"},

 *         }
 * 
 * @param typeDefinition  a JSON string describing the columns of the type to
 *                        be registered.
 * @param label  A user-defined description string which can be used to
 *               differentiate between tables and types with otherwise
 *               identical schemas.
 * @param properties  Each key-value pair specifies the properties to use for a
 *                    given column where the key is the column name.  All keys
 *                    used must be relevant column names for the given table.
 *                    Specifying any property overrides the default properties
 *                    for that column (which is based on the column's data
 *                    type).
 *                    <ul>
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_data: Default property
 *                    for all numeric and string type columns; makes the column
 *                    available for GPU queries.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_text_search: Valid only
 *                    for select 'string' columns. Enables full text
 *                    search--see <a href="../../../concepts/full_text_search/"
 *                    target="_top">Full Text Search</a> for details and
 *                    applicable string column types. Can be set independently
 *                    of @a data and @a store_only.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_store_only: Persist the
 *                    column value but do not make it available to queries
 *                    (e.g. /filter)-i.e. it is mutually exclusive to the @a
 *                    data property. Any 'bytes' type column must have a @a
 *                    store_only property. This property reduces system memory
 *                    usage.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_disk_optimized: Works in
 *                    conjunction with the @a data property for string columns.
 *                    This property reduces system disk usage by disabling
 *                    reverse string lookups. Queries like /filter,
 *                    /filter/bylist, and /filter/byvalue work as usual but
 *                    /aggregate/unique and /aggregate/groupby are not allowed
 *                    on columns with this property.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_timestamp: Valid only for
 *                    'long' columns. Indicates that this field represents a
 *                    timestamp and will be provided in milliseconds since the
 *                    Unix epoch: 00:00:00 Jan 1 1970.  Dates represented by a
 *                    timestamp must fall between the year 1000 and the year
 *                    2900.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_ulong: Valid only for
 *                    'string' columns.  It represents an unsigned long integer
 *                    data type. The string can only be interpreted as an
 *                    unsigned long data type with minimum value of zero, and
 *                    maximum value of 18446744073709551615.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_uuid: Valid only for
 *                    'string' columns.  It represents an uuid data type.
 *                    Internally, it is stored as a 128-bit integer.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_decimal: Valid only for
 *                    'string' columns.  It represents a SQL type NUMERIC(19,
 *                    4) data type.  There can be up to 15 digits before the
 *                    decimal point and up to four digits in the fractional
 *                    part.  The value can be positive or negative (indicated
 *                    by a minus sign at the beginning).  This property is
 *                    mutually exclusive with the @a text_search property.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_date: Valid only for
 *                    'string' columns.  Indicates that this field represents a
 *                    date and will be provided in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD'.
 *                    The allowable range is 1000-01-01 through 2900-01-01.
 *                    This property is mutually exclusive with the @a
 *                    text_search property.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_time: Valid only for
 *                    'string' columns.  Indicates that this field represents a
 *                    time-of-day and will be provided in the format
 *                    'HH:MM:SS.mmm'.  The allowable range is 00:00:00.000
 *                    through 23:59:59.999.  This property is mutually
 *                    exclusive with the @a text_search property.

 *                    contains geospatial geometry objects in Well-Known Text
 *                    (WKT) or Well-Known Binary (WKB) format.

 *                    the entire) <a
 *                    href="../../../concepts/tables/#primary-keys"

 *                    target="_top">shard key</a>.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_nullable: This property
 *                    indicates that this column is nullable.  However, setting
 *                    this property is insufficient for making the column
 *                    nullable.  The user must declare the type of the column
 *                    as a union between its regular type and 'null' in the
 *                    avro schema for the record type in @a typeDefinition.
 *                    For example, if a column is of type integer and is
 *                    nullable, then the entry for the column in the avro
 *                    schema must be: ['int', 'null'].
 *                    The C++, C#, Java, and Python APIs have built-in
 *                    convenience for bypassing setting the avro schema by
 *                    hand.  For those languages, one can use this property as
 *                    usual and not have to worry about the avro schema for the
 *                    record.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_dict: This property
 *                    indicates that this column should be <a
 *                    href="../../../concepts/dictionary_encoding/"
 *                    target="_top">dictionary encoded</a>. It can only be used
 *                    in conjunction with restricted string (charN), int, long
 *                    or date columns. Dictionary encoding is best for columns
 *                    where the cardinality (the number of unique values) is
 *                    expected to be low. This property can save a large amount
 *                    of memory.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_init_with_now: For
 *                    'date', 'time', 'datetime', or 'timestamp' column types,
 *                    replace empty strings and invalid timestamps with 'NOW()'
 *                    upon insert.
 *                            <li> gpudb::create_type_init_with_uuid: For
 *                    'uuid' type, replace empty strings and invalid UUID
 *                    values with randomly-generated UUIDs upon insert.
 *                    </ul>
 * @param options  Optional parameters.
 * @param[out] response_  Response object containing the results of the
 *                        operation.
 * 
 * @return Response object containing the result of the operation (initially

/**
 * Export records from a table to files. All tables can be exported, in full or
 * partial
 * (see @a columns_to_export and @a columns_to_skip).
 * Additional filtering can be applied when using export table with expression
 * through SQL.
 * Default destination is KIFS, though other storage types (Azure, S3, GCS, and
 * HDFS) are supported
 * through @a datasink_name; see {@link
 * #createDatasink(const std::string&,const std::string&,const std::map<std::string, std::string>&,CreateDatasinkResponse&) const}.
 * <p>
 * Server's local file system is not supported.  Default file format is
 * delimited text. See options for
 * different file types and different options for each file type.  Table is
 * saved to a single file if
 * within max file size limits (may vary depending on datasink type).  If not,
 * then table is split into
 * multiple files; these may be smaller than the max size limit.
 * <p>
 * All filenames created are returned in the response.
 * 
 * @param tableName
 * @param filepath  Path to data export target.  If @a filepath has a file
 *                  extension, it is
 *                  read as the name of a file. If @a filepath is a directory,
 *                  then the source table name with a
 *                  random UUID appended will be used as the name of each
 *                  exported file, all written to that directory.
 *                  If filepath is a filename, then all exported files will
 *                  have a random UUID appended to the given
 *                  name.  In either case, the target directory specified or
 *                  implied must exist.  The names of all
 *                  exported files are returned in the response.

 *                 to maps of column properties to their
 *                 corresponding column formats, e.g.,

 *                 Column names can be provided, in which case the target file
 *                 will use those names as the column
 *                 headers as well.
 *                 Alternatively, column numbers can be specified--discretely
 *                 or as a range.  For example, a value of

 *                 format for a given source column in
 *                 @a column_formats. For each specified annotation, the format

 *                 for that
 *                 annotation are specified.
 *                 The parameter value must be formatted as a JSON string that
 *                 is a map of column properties to their
 *                 respective column formats, e.g., '{ "date" : "%Y.%m.%d",

 *                 characters are 'Y', 'm', 'd', 'H', 'M', 'S', and 's', which
 *                 follow the Linux 'strptime()'
 *                 specification, as well as 's', which specifies seconds and
 *                 fractional seconds (though the fractional

 * Calculates which objects from a table has a particular value for a

 * be
 * returned until all the objects are fully available. The response payload
 * provides the count of the resulting set. A new result view which satisfies

 *                 source data, this list can be used to match the order of the
 *                 target table.  For example, a value of

 *                 followed by column B, followed by column
 *                 A; or will insert those fields in that order into a table
 *                 created with columns in that order.  If

 *                 into columns with the corresponding column property.
 *                 Currently supported column properties include
 *                 date, time, & datetime.  This default column-property-bound
 *                 format can be overridden by specifying a
 *                 column property & format for a given target column in @a
 *                 column_formats. For
 *                 each specified annotation, the format will apply to all
 *                 columns with that annotation unless a custom
 *                 @a column_formats for that annotation is specified.
 *                 The parameter value must be formatted as a JSON string that
 *                 is a map of column properties to their
 *                 respective column formats, e.g., '{ "date" : "%Y.%m.%d",
 *                 "time" : "%H:%M:%S" }'.  Column
 *                 formats are specified as a string of control characters and
 *                 plain text. The supported control
 *                 characters are 'Y', 'm', 'd', 'H', 'M', 'S', and 's', which
 *                 follow the Linux 'strptime()'
 *                 specification, as well as 's', which specifies seconds and
 *                 fractional seconds (though the fractional
 *                 component will be truncated past milliseconds).
 *                 Formats for the 'date' annotation must include the 'Y', 'm',
 *                 and 'd' control characters. Formats for
 *                 the 'time' annotation must include the 'H', 'M', and either
 *                 'S' or 's' (but not both) control
 *                 characters. Formats for the 'datetime' annotation meet both
 *                 the 'date' and 'time' control character
 *                 requirements. For example, '{"datetime" : "%m/%d/%Y
 *                 %H:%M:%S" }' would be used to interpret text
 *                 as "05/04/2000 12:12:11"

 *                 that are available to it. This option works best when each
 *                 worker loads files from its own file
 *                 system, to maximize performance. In order to avoid data
 *                 duplication, either each worker performing
 *                 the load needs to have visibility to a set of files unique
 *                 to it (no file is visible to more than
 *                 one node) or the target table needs to have a primary key

 *                 automatically deduplicate data).
 *                 NOTE:
 *                 If the target table doesn't exist, the table structure will
 *                 be determined by the head node. If the
 *                 head node has no files local to it, it will be unable to
 *                 determine the structure and the request
 *                 will fail.
 *                 If the head node is configured to have no worker processes,
 *                 no data strictly accessible to the head

 *                 return, horizontal tab, & vertical tab,
 *                 respectively.  For example, the escape character followed by
 *                 an 'n' will be interpreted as a newline
 *                 within a field value.
 *                 The escape character can also be used to escape the quoting
 *                 character, and will be treated as an
 *                 escape character whether it is within a quoted field value

 *                 value in the source data.
 *                 For @a delimited_text @a file_type only.  The default value

 *                 appear at beginning and end of field value
 *                 to take effect.  Delimiters within quoted fields are treated
 *                 as literals and not delimiters.  Within

/**
 * Reads from one or more files and inserts the data into a new or existing
 * table.
 * The source data can be located either in <a href="../../../tools/kifs/"
 * target="_top">KiFS</a>; on the cluster, accessible to the database; or
 * remotely, accessible via a pre-defined external <a
 * href="../../../concepts/data_sources/" target="_top">data source</a>.
 * <p>

 * For delimited text files, there are two loading schemes: positional and
 * name-based. The name-based
 * loading scheme is enabled when the file has a header present and
 * @a text_has_header is set to
 * @a true. In this scheme, the source file(s) field names
 * must match the target table's column names exactly; however, the source file
 * can have more fields
 * than the target table has columns. If @a error_handling is set to
 * @a permissive, the source file can have fewer fields
 * than the target table has columns. If the name-based loading scheme is being
 * used, names matching
 * the file header's names may be provided to @a columns_to_load instead of
 * numbers, but ranges are not supported.
 * <p>
 * Note: Due to data being loaded in parallel, there is no insertion order
 * guaranteed.  For tables with
 * primary keys, in the case of a primary key collision, this means it is
 * indeterminate which record
 * will be inserted first and remain, while the rest of the colliding key
 * records are discarded.
 * <p>
 * Returns once all files are processed.
 * 
 * @param tableName  Name of the table into which the data will be inserted, in
 *                   [schema_name.]table_name format, using standard
 *                   <a href="../../../concepts/tables/#table-name-resolution"
 *                   target="_top">name resolution rules</a>.
 *                   If the table does not exist, the table will be created
 *                   using either an existing
 *                   @a type_id or the type inferred from the
 *                   file, and the new table name will have to meet standard
 *                   <a href="../../../concepts/tables/#table-naming-criteria"
 *                   target="_top">table naming criteria</a>.
 * @param filepaths  A list of file paths from which data will be sourced;
 *                   For paths in <a href="../../../tools/kifs/"
 *                   target="_top">KiFS</a>, use the uri prefix of kifs://
 *                   followed by the path to
 *                   a file or directory. File matching by prefix is supported,
 *                   e.g. kifs://dir/file would match dir/file_1
 *                   and dir/file_2. When prefix matching is used, the path
 *                   must start with a full, valid KiFS directory name.
 *                   If an external data source is specified in @a
 *                   datasource_name, these file
 *                   paths must resolve to accessible files at that data source
 *                   location. Prefix matching is supported.
 *                   If the data source is hdfs, prefixes must be aligned with
 *                   directories, i.e. partial file names will
 *                   not match.
 *                   If no data source is specified, the files are assumed to
 *                   be local to the database and must all be
 *                   accessible to the gpudb user, residing on the path (or
 *                   relative to the path) specified by the
 *                   external files directory in the Kinetica
 *                   <a href="../../../config/#config-main-external-files"
 *                   target="_top">configuration file</a>. Wildcards (*) can be
 *                   used to
 *                   specify a group of files.  Prefix matching is supported,
 *                   the prefixes must be aligned with
 *                   directories.
 *                   If the first path ends in .tsv, the text delimiter will be
 *                   defaulted to a tab character.
 *                   If the first path ends in .psv, the text delimiter will be

 *                 Column numbers can be specified discretely or as a range.
 *                 For example, a value of '5,7,1..3' will
 *                 insert values from the fifth column in the source data into
 *                 the first column in the target table,

 *                 third through fifth columns in the target
 *                 table.
 *                 If the source data contains a header, column names matching
 *                 the file header names may be provided
 *                 instead of column numbers.  If the target table doesn't
 *                 exist, the table will be created with the

 *                 columns in a different order than the
 *                 source data, this list can be used to match the order of the
 *                 target table.  For example, a value of
 *                 'C, B, A' will create a three column table with column C,
 *                 followed by column B, followed by column
 *                 A; or will insert those fields in that order into a table
 *                 created with columns in that order.  If
 *                 the target table exists, the column names must match the
 *                 source data field names for a name-mapping
 *                 to be successful.

 *                 columns with that annotation unless a custom
 *                 @a column_formats for that annotation is specified.
 *                 The parameter value must be formatted as a JSON string that
 *                 is a map of column properties to their
 *                 respective column formats, e.g., '{ "date" : "%Y.%m.%d",
 *                 "time" : "%H:%M:%S" }'.  Column
 *                 formats are specified as a string of control characters and
 *                 plain text. The supported control
 *                 characters are 'Y', 'm', 'd', 'H', 'M', 'S', and 's', which
 *                 follow the Linux 'strptime()'
 *                 specification, as well as 's', which specifies seconds and
 *                 fractional seconds (though the fractional
 *                 component will be truncated past milliseconds).
 *                 Formats for the 'date' annotation must include the 'Y', 'm',
 *                 and 'd' control characters. Formats for
 *                 the 'time' annotation must include the 'H', 'M', and either
 *                 'S' or 's' (but not both) control
 *                 characters. Formats for the 'datetime' annotation meet both
 *                 the 'date' and 'time' control character
 *                 requirements. For example, '{"datetime" : "%m/%d/%Y
 *                 %H:%M:%S" }' would be used to interpret text
 *                 as "05/04/2000 12:12:11"

 *                 worker process on each node loads all files
 *                 that are available to it. This option works best when each
 *                 worker loads files from its own file
 *                 system, to maximize performance. In order to avoid data
 *                 duplication, either each worker performing
 *                 the load needs to have visibility to a set of files unique
 *                 to it (no file is visible to more than
 *                 one node) or the target table needs to have a primary key
 *                 (which will allow the worker to
 *                 automatically deduplicate data).
 *                 NOTE:
 *                 If the target table doesn't exist, the table structure will
 *                 be determined by the head node. If the
 *                 head node has no files local to it, it will be unable to
 *                 determine the structure and the request
 *                 will fail.
 *                 If the head node is configured to have no worker processes,
 *                 no data strictly accessible to the head

 *                 applies to all files.
 *                 Column numbers can be specified discretely or as a range.
 *                 For example, a value of '5,7,1..3' will
 *                 insert values from the fifth column in the source data into
 *                 the first column in the target table,
 *                 from the seventh column in the source data into the second
 *                 column in the target table, and from the
 *                 first through third columns in the source data into the
 *                 third through fifth columns in the target
 *                 table.
 *                 If the source data contains a header, column names matching
 *                 the file header names may be provided
 *                 instead of column numbers.  If the target table doesn't
 *                 exist, the table will be created with the
 *                 columns in this order.  If the target table does exist with
 *                 columns in a different order than the
 *                 source data, this list can be used to match the order of the
 *                 target table.  For example, a value of
 *                 'C, B, A' will create a three column table with column C,
 *                 followed by column B, followed by column
 *                 A; or will insert those fields in that order into a table
 *                 created with columns in that order.  If
 *                 the target table exists, the column names must match the
 *                 source data field names for a name-mapping
 *                 to be successful.

 *                 formats are specified as a string of control characters and

 *                 fractional seconds (though the fractional
 *                 component will be truncated past milliseconds).
 *                 Formats for the 'date' annotation must include the 'Y', 'm',

 *                 the 'date' and 'time' control character
 *                 requirements. For example, '{"datetime" : "%m/%d/%Y

 *                 single worker process on each node loads all files
 *                 that are available to it. This option works best when each
 *                 worker loads files from its own file
 *                 system, to maximize performance. In order to avoid data
 *                 duplication, either each worker performing
 *                 the load needs to have visibility to a set of files unique
 *                 to it (no file is visible to more than
 *                 one node) or the target table needs to have a primary key
 *                 (which will allow the worker to
 *                 automatically deduplicate data).
 *                 NOTE:
 *                 If the target table doesn't exist, the table structure will
 *                 be determined by the head node. If the
 *                 head node has no files local to it, it will be unable to
 *                 determine the structure and the request
 *                 will fail.
 *                 If the head node is configured to have no worker processes,
 *                 no data strictly accessible to the head
 *                 node will be loaded.

 *                 column names to maps of column properties to their
 *                 corresponding column formats, e.g.,

 *                 load.  If more than one file is being loaded, this list
 *                 applies to all files.
 *                 Column numbers can be specified discretely or as a range.
 *                 For example, a value of '5,7,1..3' will
 *                 insert values from the fifth column in the source data into
 *                 the first column in the target table,
 *                 from the seventh column in the source data into the second
 *                 column in the target table, and from the
 *                 first through third columns in the source data into the
 *                 third through fifth columns in the target
 *                 table.
 *                 If the source data contains a header, column names matching
 *                 the file header names may be provided
 *                 instead of column numbers.  If the target table doesn't
 *                 exist, the table will be created with the
 *                 columns in this order.  If the target table does exist with
 *                 columns in a different order than the
 *                 source data, this list can be used to match the order of the
 *                 target table.  For example, a value of
 *                 'C, B, A' will create a three column table with column C,
 *                 followed by column B, followed by column
 *                 A; or will insert those fields in that order into a table
 *                 created with columns in that order.  If
 *                 the target table exists, the column names must match the
 *                 source data field names for a name-mapping
 *                 to be successful.

 *                 loaded
 *                 into columns with the corresponding column property.
 *                 Currently supported column properties include
 *                 date, time, & datetime.  This default column-property-bound
 *                 format can be overridden by specifying a
 *                 column property & format for a given target column in @a
 *                 column_formats. For
 *                 each specified annotation, the format will apply to all
 *                 columns with that annotation unless a custom
 *                 @a column_formats for that annotation is specified.
 *                 The parameter value must be formatted as a JSON string that
 *                 is a map of column properties to their
 *                 respective column formats, e.g., '{ "date" : "%Y.%m.%d",
 *                 "time" : "%H:%M:%S" }'.  Column
 *                 formats are specified as a string of control characters and
 *                 plain text. The supported control
 *                 characters are 'Y', 'm', 'd', 'H', 'M', 'S', and 's', which
 *                 follow the Linux 'strptime()'
 *                 specification, as well as 's', which specifies seconds and
 *                 fractional seconds (though the fractional
 *                 component will be truncated past milliseconds).
 *                 Formats for the 'date' annotation must include the 'Y', 'm',
 *                 and 'd' control characters. Formats for
 *                 the 'time' annotation must include the 'H', 'M', and either
 *                 'S' or 's' (but not both) control
 *                 characters. Formats for the 'datetime' annotation meet both
 *                 the 'date' and 'time' control character
 *                 requirements. For example, '{"datetime" : "%m/%d/%Y
 *                 %H:%M:%S" }' would be used to interpret text
 *                 as "05/04/2000 12:12:11"

 *                         <li>
 *                 gpudb::insert_records_from_payload_distributed_shared: The

 *                 processes across all nodes from shared files available to
 *                 all workers.
 *                 NOTE:
 *                 Instead of existing on a shared source, the files can be
 *                 duplicated on a source local to each host
 *                 to improve performance, though the files must appear as the
 *                 same data set from the perspective of
 *                 all hosts performing the load.
 *                         <li>
 *                 gpudb::insert_records_from_payload_distributed_local: A
 *                 single worker process on each node loads all files
 *                 that are available to it. This option works best when each
 *                 worker loads files from its own file
 *                 system, to maximize performance. In order to avoid data
 *                 duplication, either each worker performing
 *                 the load needs to have visibility to a set of files unique
 *                 to it (no file is visible to more than
 *                 one node) or the target table needs to have a primary key
 *                 (which will allow the worker to
 *                 automatically deduplicate data).
 *                 NOTE:
 *                 If the target table doesn't exist, the table structure will
 *                 be determined by the head node. If the
 *                 head node has no files local to it, it will be unable to
 *                 determine the structure and the request
 *                 will fail.
 *                 If the head node is configured to have no worker processes,
 *                 no data strictly accessible to the head
 *                 node will be loaded.

 *                 *options* parameter of most other endpoints in that it is a
 *                 map of string to map of string to doubles, while most others
 *                 are maps of string to string.  In this map, the top level
 *                 keys represent which column's parameters are being
 *                 specified, while the internal keys represents which
 *                 parameter is being specified.  These parameters take on
 *                 different meanings depending on the type of the column.
 *                 Below follows a more detailed description of the map:
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_seed: If provided,
 *                 the internal random number generator will be initialized
 *                 with the given value.  The minimum is 0.  This allows for
 *                 the same set of random numbers to be generated across
 *                 invocation of this endpoint in case the user wants to repeat
 *                 the test.  Since @a options, is a map of maps, we need an
 *                 internal map to provide the seed value.  For example, to
 *                 pass 100 as the seed value through this parameter, you need
 *                 something equivalent to: 'options' = {'seed': { 'value': 100
 *                 } }
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_value: The seed
 *                 value to use
 *                 </ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_all: This key
 *                 indicates that the specifications relayed in the internal
 *                 map are to be applied to all columns of the records.
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_min: For numerical
 *                 columns, the minimum of the generated values is set to this
 *                 value.  Default is -99999.  For point, shape, and track
 *                 columns, min for numeric 'x' and 'y' columns needs to be
 *                 within [-180, 180] and [-90, 90], respectively. The default
 *                 minimum possible values for these columns in such cases are
 *                 -180.0 and -90.0. For the 'TIMESTAMP' column, the default
 *                 minimum corresponds to Jan 1, 2010.
 *                 For string columns, the minimum length of the randomly
 *                 generated strings is set to this value (default is 0). If
 *                 both minimum and maximum are provided, minimum must be less
 *                 than or equal to max. Value needs to be within [0, 200].
 *                 If the min is outside the accepted ranges for strings
 *                 columns and 'x' and 'y' columns for point/shape/track, then
 *                 those parameters will not be set; however, an error will not
 *                 be thrown in such a case. It is the responsibility of the
 *                 user to use the @a all parameter judiciously.
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_max: For numerical
 *                 columns, the maximum of the generated values is set to this
 *                 value. Default is 99999. For point, shape, and track
 *                 columns, max for numeric 'x' and 'y' columns needs to be
 *                 within [-180, 180] and [-90, 90], respectively. The default
 *                 minimum possible values for these columns in such cases are
 *                 180.0 and 90.0.
 *                 For string columns, the maximum length of the randomly
 *                 generated strings is set to this value (default is 200). If
 *                 both minimum and maximum are provided, *max* must be greater
 *                 than or equal to *min*. Value needs to be within [0, 200].
 *                 If the *max* is outside the accepted ranges for strings
 *                 columns and 'x' and 'y' columns for point/shape/track, then
 *                 those parameters will not be set; however, an error will not
 *                 be thrown in such a case. It is the responsibility of the

 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_interval: If
 *                 specified, generate values for all columns evenly spaced
 *                 with the given interval value. If a max value is specified
 *                 for a given column the data is randomly generated between
 *                 min and max and decimated down to the interval. If no max is
 *                 provided the data is linerally generated starting at the
 *                 minimum value (instead of generating random data). For
 *                 non-decimated string-type columns the interval value is
 *                 ignored. Instead the values are generated following the
 *                 pattern: 'attrname_creationIndex#', i.e. the column name
 *                 suffixed with an underscore and a running counter (starting
 *                 at 0). For string types with limited size (eg char4) the
 *                 prefix is dropped. No nulls will be generated for nullable
 *                 columns.
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_null_percentage:
 *                 If specified, then generate the given percentage of the
 *                 count as nulls for all nullable columns.  This option will
 *                 be ignored for non-nullable columns.  The value must be
 *                 within the range [0, 1.0].  The default value is 5% (0.05).
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_cardinality: If
 *                 specified, limit the randomly generated values to a fixed
 *                 set. Not allowed on a column with interval specified, and is
 *                 not applicable to WKT or Track-specific columns. The value
 *                 must be greater than 0. This option is disabled by default.
 *                 </ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_attr_name: Use the
 *                 desired column name in place of @a attr_name, and set the
 *                 following parameters for the column specified. This
 *                 overrides any parameter set by @a all.
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_min: For numerical
 *                 columns, the minimum of the generated values is set to this
 *                 value.  Default is -99999.  For point, shape, and track
 *                 columns, min for numeric 'x' and 'y' columns needs to be
 *                 within [-180, 180] and [-90, 90], respectively. The default

/**
 * Generates a specified number of random records and adds them to the given
 * table.
 * There is an optional parameter that allows the user to customize the ranges
 * of
 * the column values. It also allows the user to specify linear profiles for
 * some
 * or all columns in which case linear values are generated rather than random
 * ones. Only individual tables are supported for this operation.
 * <p>
 * This operation is synchronous, meaning that a response will not be returned
 * until all random records are fully available.
 * 
 * @param tableName  Table to which random records will be added, in
 *                   [schema_name.]table_name format, using standard <a
 *                   href="../../../concepts/tables/#table-name-resolution"
 *                   target="_top">name resolution rules</a>.  Must be an
 *                   existing table, not a view.
 * @param count  Number of records to generate.
 * @param options  Optional parameter to pass in specifications for the
 *                 randomness of the values.  This map is different from the
 *                 *options* parameter of most other endpoints in that it is a
 *                 map of string to map of string to doubles, while most others
 *                 are maps of string to string.  In this map, the top level
 *                 keys represent which column's parameters are being
 *                 specified, while the internal keys represents which
 *                 parameter is being specified.  These parameters take on
 *                 different meanings depending on the type of the column.
 *                 Below follows a more detailed description of the map:
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_seed: If provided,
 *                 the internal random number generator will be initialized
 *                 with the given value.  The minimum is 0.  This allows for
 *                 the same set of random numbers to be generated across
 *                 invocation of this endpoint in case the user wants to repeat
 *                 the test.  Since @a options, is a map of maps, we need an
 *                 internal map to provide the seed value.  For example, to
 *                 pass 100 as the seed value through this parameter, you need
 *                 something equivalent to: 'options' = {'seed': { 'value': 100
 *                 } }
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_value: The seed
 *                 value to use
 *                 </ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_all: This key
 *                 indicates that the specifications relayed in the internal
 *                 map are to be applied to all columns of the records.
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_min: For numerical
 *                 columns, the minimum of the generated values is set to this
 *                 value.  Default is -99999.  For point, shape, and track
 *                 columns, min for numeric 'x' and 'y' columns needs to be
 *                 within [-180, 180] and [-90, 90], respectively. The default
 *                 minimum possible values for these columns in such cases are
 *                 -180.0 and -90.0. For the 'TIMESTAMP' column, the default
 *                 minimum corresponds to Jan 1, 2010.
 *                 For string columns, the minimum length of the randomly
 *                 generated strings is set to this value (default is 0). If
 *                 both minimum and maximum are provided, minimum must be less
 *                 than or equal to max. Value needs to be within [0, 200].
 *                 If the min is outside the accepted ranges for strings
 *                 columns and 'x' and 'y' columns for point/shape/track, then
 *                 those parameters will not be set; however, an error will not
 *                 be thrown in such a case. It is the responsibility of the
 *                 user to use the @a all parameter judiciously.
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_max: For numerical
 *                 columns, the maximum of the generated values is set to this
 *                 value. Default is 99999. For point, shape, and track
 *                 columns, max for numeric 'x' and 'y' columns needs to be
 *                 within [-180, 180] and [-90, 90], respectively. The default
 *                 minimum possible values for these columns in such cases are
 *                 180.0 and 90.0.
 *                 For string columns, the maximum length of the randomly
 *                 generated strings is set to this value (default is 200). If
 *                 both minimum and maximum are provided, *max* must be greater
 *                 than or equal to *min*. Value needs to be within [0, 200].
 *                 If the *max* is outside the accepted ranges for strings
 *                 columns and 'x' and 'y' columns for point/shape/track, then
 *                 those parameters will not be set; however, an error will not
 *                 be thrown in such a case. It is the responsibility of the
 *                 user to use the @a all parameter judiciously.
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_interval: If
 *                 specified, generate values for all columns evenly spaced
 *                 with the given interval value. If a max value is specified
 *                 for a given column the data is randomly generated between
 *                 min and max and decimated down to the interval. If no max is
 *                 provided the data is linerally generated starting at the
 *                 minimum value (instead of generating random data). For
 *                 non-decimated string-type columns the interval value is
 *                 ignored. Instead the values are generated following the
 *                 pattern: 'attrname_creationIndex#', i.e. the column name
 *                 suffixed with an underscore and a running counter (starting
 *                 at 0). For string types with limited size (eg char4) the
 *                 prefix is dropped. No nulls will be generated for nullable
 *                 columns.
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_null_percentage:
 *                 If specified, then generate the given percentage of the
 *                 count as nulls for all nullable columns.  This option will
 *                 be ignored for non-nullable columns.  The value must be
 *                 within the range [0, 1.0].  The default value is 5% (0.05).
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_cardinality: If
 *                 specified, limit the randomly generated values to a fixed
 *                 set. Not allowed on a column with interval specified, and is
 *                 not applicable to WKT or Track-specific columns. The value
 *                 must be greater than 0. This option is disabled by default.
 *                 </ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_attr_name: Use the
 *                 desired column name in place of @a attr_name, and set the
 *                 following parameters for the column specified. This
 *                 overrides any parameter set by @a all.
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::insert_records_random_min: For numerical
 *                 columns, the minimum of the generated values is set to this
 *                 value.  Default is -99999.  For point, shape, and track
 *                 columns, min for numeric 'x' and 'y' columns needs to be
 *                 within [-180, 180] and [-90, 90], respectively. The default
 *                 minimum possible values for these columns in such cases are
 *                 -180.0 and -90.0. For the 'TIMESTAMP' column, the default

 *                 columns and 'x' and 'y' columns for point/shape/track, then
 *                 those parameters will not be set; however, an error will not
 *                 be thrown in such a case. It is the responsibility of the

/**
 * Adds a symbol or icon (i.e. an image) to represent data points when data is
 * rendered visually. Users must provide the symbol identifier (string), a
 * format (currently supported: 'svg' and 'svg_path'), the data for the symbol,
 * and any additional optional parameter (e.g. color). To have a symbol used
 * for rendering create a table with a string column named 'SYMBOLCODE' (along
 * with 'x' or 'y' for example). Then when the table is rendered (via <a
 * href="../../../api/rest/wms_rest/" target="_top">WMS</a>) if the
 * 'dosymbology' parameter is 'true' then the value of the 'SYMBOLCODE' column
 * is used to pick the symbol displayed for each point.
 * 
 * @param symbolId  The id of the symbol being added. This is the same id that
 *                  should be in the 'SYMBOLCODE' column for objects using this
 *                  symbol
 * @param symbolFormat  Specifies the symbol format. Must be either 'svg' or
 *                      'svg_path'.

 * @param symbolData  The actual symbol data. If @a symbolFormat is 'svg' then
 *                    this should be the raw bytes representing an svg file. If
 *                    @a symbolFormat is svg path then this should be an svg
 *                    path string, for example:
 *                    'M25.979,12.896,5.979,12.896,5.979,19.562,25.979,19.562z'

 *                 then this option specifies the color (in RRGGBB hex format)
 *                 of the path. For example, to have the path rendered in red,
 *                 used 'FF0000'. If 'color' is not provided then '00FF00'
 *                 (i.e. green) is used by default.

 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_sharp_turn_penalty: This
 *                 will add an additonal weight over the edges labelled as

 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_aggregated_output: For the
 *                 @a match_supply_demand solver only. When it is true
 *                 (default), each record in the output table shows a
 *                 particular truck's scheduled cumulative round trip path
 *                 (MULTILINESTRING) and the corresponding aggregated cost.
 *                 Otherwise, each record shows a single scheduled truck route
 *                 (LINESTRING) towards a particular demand location (store id)
 *                 with its corresponding cost.  The default value is 'true'.

 *                 match_supply_demand solver only. When it is true
 *                 (non-default), the output will be in tracks format for all
 *                 the round trips of each truck in which the timestamps are
 *                 populated directly from the edge weights starting from their
 *                 originating depots.  The default value is 'false'.
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_max_trip_cost: For the @a
 *                 match_supply_demand and @a match_pickup_dropoff solvers
 *                 only. If this constraint is greater than zero (default) then
 *                 the trucks/rides will skip travelling from one demand/pick
 *                 location to another if the cost between them is greater than
 *                 this number (distance or time). Zero (default) value means
 *                 no check is performed.  The default value is '0.0'.
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_filter_folding_paths: For
 *                 the @a markov_chain solver only. When true (non-default),
 *                 the paths per sequence combination is checked for folding
 *                 over patterns and can significantly increase the execution
 *                 time depending on the chain width and the number of gps
 *                 samples.
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_true: Filter out the folded
 *                 paths.

 *                 folded paths

 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_unit_unloading_cost: For the
 *                 @a match_supply_demand solver only. The unit cost per load
 *                 amount to be delivered. If this value is greater than zero
 *                 (default) then the additional cost of this unit load
 *                 multiplied by the total dropped load will be added over to
 *                 the trip cost to the demand location.  The default value is
 *                 '0.0'.
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_max_num_threads: For the @a
 *                 markov_chain solver only. If specified (greater than zero),
 *                 the maximum number of threads will not be greater than the
 *                 specified value. It can be lower due to the memory and the
 *                 number cores available. Default value of zero allows the
 *                 algorithm to set the maximal number of threads within these
 *                 constraints.  The default value is '0'.
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_service_limit: For the @a
 *                 match_supply_demand solver only. If specified (greater than
 *                 zero), any supply actor's total service cost (distance or
 *                 time) will be limited by the specified value including
 *                 multiple rounds (if set).  The default value is '0.0'.
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_enable_reuse: For the @a
 *                 match_supply_demand solver only. If specified (true), all
 *                 supply actors can be scheduled for second rounds from their
 *                 originating depots.
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_true: Allows reusing supply
 *                 actors (trucks, e.g.) for scheduling again.
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_false: Supply actors are
 *                 scheduled only once from their depots.
 *                 </ul>
 *                 The default value is gpudb::match_graph_false.
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_max_stops: For the @a
 *                 match_supply_demand solver only. If specified (greater than
 *                 zero), a supply actor (truck) can at most have this many
 *                 stops (demand locations) in one round trip. Otherwise, it is
 *                 unlimited. If 'enable_truck_reuse' is on, this condition
 *                 will be applied separately at each round trip use of the
 *                 same truck.  The default value is '0'.
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_service_radius: For the @a
 *                 match_supply_demand and @a match_pickup_dropoff solvers
 *                 only. If specified (greater than zero), it filters the
 *                 demands/picks outside this radius centered around the supply
 *                 actor/ride's originating location (distance or time).  The
 *                 default value is '0.0'.
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_permute_supplies: For the @a
 *                 match_supply_demand solver only. If specified (true), supply
 *                 side actors are permuted for the demand combinations during
 *                 msdo optimization - note that this option increases
 *                 optimization time significantly - use of 'max_combinations'
 *                 option is recommended to prevent prohibitively long runs
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::match_graph_true: Generates sequences
 *                 over supply side permutations if total supply is less than
 *                 twice the total demand

 *                 MULTIPLE_ROUTING solvers only; sets the cap on the
 *                 combinatorial sequences generated. If the default value of
 *                 two millions is overridden to a lesser value, it can

 *                 to the server, amongst those containing the corresponding
 *                 graph, that has the most computational bandwidth. For
 *                 SHORTEST_PATH solver type, the input is split amongst the

 *                 add an additonal weight over the edges labelled as 'left
 *                 turn' if the 'add_turn' option parameter of the

 *                 MULTIPLE_ROUTING solvers only; sets the number of shortest
 *                 paths computed from each node. This is the heuristic
 *                 criterion. Default value of zero allows the number to be
 *                 computed automatically by the solver. The user may want to
 *                 override this parameter to speed-up the solver.  The default

 *                         <li> gpudb::solve_graph_max_num_combinations: For @a
 *                 MULTIPLE_ROUTING solvers only; sets the cap on the
 *                 combinatorial sequences generated. If the default value of
 *                 two millions is overridden to a lesser value, it can
 *                 potentially speed up the solver.  The default value is

 *                 The default value is gpudb::solve_graph_false.
 *                         <li> gpudb::solve_graph_output_wkt_path: If true

 *                 graph server(s) to send the request to. Default is to send
 *                 to the server, amongst those containing the corresponding
 *                 graph, that has the most computational bandwidth. For
 *                 SHORTEST_PATH solver type, the input is split amongst the
 *                 server containing the corresponding graph.
 *                         <li> gpudb::solve_graph_convergence_limit: For @a

 *                 on the pagerank scores of each node between consecutive

 *                 CENTRALITY solvers only; Sets the maximum number of shortest
 *                 path runs; maximum possible value is the number of nodes in
 *                 the graph. Default value of 0 enables this value to be auto
 *                 computed by the solver.  The default value is '0'.
 *                         <li> gpudb::solve_graph_output_clusters: For @a
 *                 STATS_ALL solvers only; the cluster index for each node will

 *                 heuristic search criterion only for the geo graphs and
 *                 shortest path solves towards a single target
 *                 <ul>
 *                         <li> gpudb::solve_graph_astar: Employs A-STAR
 *                 heuristics to speed up the shortest path traversal
 *                         <li> gpudb::solve_graph_none: No heuristics are

 * Graphs & Solvers</a>
 * for more information on graphs.
 * 
 * @param graphName  Name of the graph on which the isochrone is to be
 *                   computed.
 * @param sourceNode  Starting vertex on the underlying graph from/to which the
 *                    isochrones are created.
 * @param maxSolutionRadius  Extent of the search radius around @a sourceNode.
 *                           Set to '-1.0' for unrestricted search radius.
 * @param weightsOnEdges  Additional weights to apply to the edges of an
